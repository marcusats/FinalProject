# FinalProject - Portable Laser Engraver Powered by Raspberry Pi.

# - Overview -

    -The Raspberry Pi would read the Gcode sent from another device using SSH, it will run a program that powers 2 motors, 
     X and Y axis. 
     The Laser would move in just one of the axis and the engraving surface in the other axis.
