# FinalProject - Portable Laser Engraver Powered by Raspberry Pi.

# - Overview -

    -The Raspberry Pi would read the Gcode sent from another device using SSH, it will run a program that powers 2 motors, 
     X and Y axis. 
     The Laser would move in just one of the axis and the engraving surface in the other axis.

# - Materials - 

    - Raspberry Pi
    - 2 CD drive stepper motors
    - 200 mW 650 mm laser diode and laser housing
    - 2 dual channel H-bridges
    - LM317 regulator (MOSFET transistor)

# - Description -
    -Using the stepper motors from two CD drives, I was able to make both the X and Y axis of a laser engraving machine powered by a Raspberry Pi. I successfully       -made the functionally for both axis, the code interprets Gcode and moves both motors. I was not able to 3d print a stand for the laser, however, I successfully     -calculated the voltage needed to engrave in wood.
